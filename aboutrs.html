    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Over the course of eight decades, a lot has changed about us. We have relocated, undergone expansion, developed new product lines & added segments, opened retail chains & stores across
    India and embraced new markets overseas. One thing hasn’t changed - we’re still a tight-knit family business, committed to serving the most authentic taste of India through our food.<br><br>

Our origins can be traced back to a small namkeen shop in Nagpur founded by Gazala Bashri Qaiser. This modest quickly gained popularity and scaled up to meet a booming demand for its unique-
tasting cuisins.Building on this legacy, her husband and daughters,  Mr. Omar Qaiser, Aabiya Saher Qaiser, Aisha Labeeba Qaiser steered the business towards the heights it has tasted today.<br><br>

Determined to take cuisins beyond the boundaries of Nagpur, he shifted base to pune in 2017. We opened our first full-production unit to introduce a delectable variety of cuisins to the market.
The success of this venture led us to expand and evolve as a brand.<br><br>

From our formative years, she instilled the value of keeping the tradition and quality intact, even as we matured as a company. The ingredients and recipes were picked to accentuate 
these ideas and are followed to this date. We promise that all our cuisins have a homemade feel to them.<br><br>

Although, Fantastic Food is about more than just food. By creating a strong sense of community and supporting our associates, we continue to feel like a true family business.
We carry these values with us as we operate together to serve generations of happy connoisseurs across the globe and continue to be the nation’s beloved food company.<br><br>

As the age old saying goes, <b>“The way to one’s heart courses through their stomach”</b>. We want to leave no stone unturned to win your hearts.<br>
